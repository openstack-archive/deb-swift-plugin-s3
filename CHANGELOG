    * new ACL mechanism partially support

        Swift3 now has a couple of ACL scheme. One is a traditional scheme
        using native container ACL conpatible with backend Swift. The other
        is new scheme called 's3acl' that works as completely compatible with
        actual S3 ACLs. The new scheme is build espicially forcused on:

        - Single bucket namespace

        - Owner/Grant achievement

        - Object ACL support

        Note that the new scheme is still under development, so don't use it
        for production w/o enough testing.
